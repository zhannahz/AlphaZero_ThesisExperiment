# AlphaZero_ThesisExperiment
 
This repository houses the code for my thesis project, which is built upon the framework provided by AlphaZero Gomoku. My work extends the original [AlphaZero Gomoku](https://github.com/junxiaosong/AlphaZero_Gomoku) implementation to further explore its capabilities.

**Overview**

The project is divided into two main sections:

**Experimentation**

In the experimental component, participants engage in gameplay with trained AlphaZero models across two different board games. This setup is designed to evaluate the strategic adaptability of the AlphaZero models in varied gaming contexts.

**Analysis**

The analysis section delves into both game-level and move-level evaluations. Here, we dissect the decisions made by the models during gameplay, aiming to understand the underlying strategies and efficiencies of each move.
